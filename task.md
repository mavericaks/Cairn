## Completed Tasks Archive

| ID | Task | Completed | Notes |
|----|------|-----------|-------|
| E1-T1 | Initialize Maven project with Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.5.15 + Spring Modulith 1.4.12 + Spring AI 1.1.7 | 2026-06-12 | Maven Wrapper included. Spring AI starter renamed to `spring-ai-starter-model-openai`. Q-001/Q-002 resolved. |
| E1-T2 | Define Spring Modulith module structure (6 modules: routing, model, agents, tools, observability, security) | 2026-06-12 | Added `model` module (user-approved) to separate LLM management from routing. ADR-001 updated. |
| E1-T3 | Configure Flyway + PostgreSQL + V1 migration (pgvector + domains table) | 2026-06-12 | Datasource/JPA/Flyway configured with env var defaults (Rule 14). DB auto-config exclusions removed. HNSW index on vector(384). |
| E1-T4 | Configure SLF4J + Logback JSON structured logging with rotating file output | 2026-06-12 | Uses Spring Boot 3.5.x built-in StructuredLogEncoder (no external dep). Console: readable local / JSON prod. File: JSON, 10MB/30d/1GB. .gitignore created. |
| E1-T5 | Create multi-stage Dockerfile (eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine) | 2026-06-13 | 3-stage build (builder→layers→runtime). Fixed Boot 3.5.x jarmode deprecation (layertools→tools). Added SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod ENV. Image: 199MB, non-root cairn user. |
| E1-T6 | Create GitHub Actions CI pipeline (ci.yml — build, test, Docker build) | 2026-06-13 | 2-job workflow: build-and-test (pgvector/pgvector:pg17, Maven caching, test reports) → docker-build (image verification). Git init + remote (mavericaks/Cairn). .gitattributes added. CI green on first push (3m 1s). Rule 15 born from this task. |
| E1-T7 | Write smoke tests (context, modules, logging) with Testcontainers | 2026-06-13 | 3 classes, 10 tests. CairnApplicationTests (context, Flyway, pgvector), ModuleStructureTests (6 modules verified), LoggingConfigTests (Logback, file appender). Testcontainers @ServiceConnection (ADR-008). CI migrated from service container to Testcontainers. |
| E1-T9 | Create railway.toml deployment configuration (ADR-005) | 2026-06-13 | DOCKERFILE builder, /actuator/health check (30s), ON_FAILURE restart (3 retries), smart watchPatterns. Actuator added (health+info only). Health endpoint smoke test. 11 tests total. |
| E1-T10 | Create .env.example with all env var keys (ADR-007) | 2026-06-14 | 3 required (DB_*), 3 optional (PORT, LOG_PATH, SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE), 3 future (OPENAI_*, REDIS_URL). Format examples, Railway notes, ADR cross-refs. |
| E1-T11 | Create docker-compose.yml for local dev | 2026-06-14 | Postgres (pgvector/pgvector:pg17) and Redis (redis:7-alpine). Named volumes and healthchecks for both. Spring Boot app excluded from compose for IDE running. |
| E1-T8 | Write walkthrough_epic1.md | 2026-06-14 | Extensive architectural deep-dive into Epic 1. Explained the "Why" for Java 21, Modulith, PostgreSQL, pgvector, Flyway, and infrastructure. |
| E2-T1 | Implement Redis context cache with TTL per domain (ADR-004) | 2026-06-15 | Enforced Rule 16 (Production-Grade First). Handled null inputs, graceful degradation on Redis downtime, and added Micrometer tracking for hit/miss/failure. Testcontainers integration test covers all edge cases. |
| E1-T12 | Enterprise Hardening (Spotless, GlobalExceptionHandler, Validation, Swagger, Rate Limiting) | 2026-06-15 | Enforced static code quality, centralized error handling, input validation, API documentation, and DoS protection. |
| E2-T2 | Add DJL dependencies and implement LocalEmbeddingService | 2026-06-18 | Added Deep Java Library to calculate 384-dimensional arrays offline natively on CPU using HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2. No network requests. |
| E2-T3 | Create DomainSeeder ApplicationRunner | 2026-06-18 | Built Domain entity with hibernate-vector, DomainRepository, and DomainSeeder. Seeded 6 foundational domains at startup, dynamically calculating embeddings to avoid hardcoded tensors. |
| E2-T4 | Harden LocalEmbeddingService | 2026-06-24 | Thread safety fix, float[] return type, type-safe config binding, graceful degradation. |
| E2-T5 | Expand DomainSeeder with Example Queries | 2026-06-25 | Created domain_examples table with HNSW index. Seeded 60 total example queries dynamically. Added relationships to Domain. |
| E2-T6 | Implement DomainRouter | 2026-06-25 | Native pgvector cosine similarity search using <=> operator. Configured in-memory JPA fallback for graceful degradation on DB failure. |
| E2-T7 | Write Testcontainers integration test | 2026-06-25 | End-to-end testing proving the full Epic 2 routing pipeline works: DJL embedding -> Postgres HNSW search -> Redis cache. |
| E2-T8 | Epic 2 Walkthrough | 2026-06-25 | Wrote comprehensive walkthrough detailing the architecture and SDE standards used in Epic 2. |
| E3-T1 | Core Exception Hierarchy + Base DTOs | 2026-06-26 | Standardized exception framework with CairnException and base DTOs (ErrorResponse, PageResponse). Fixed Modulith boundaries. |
